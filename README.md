## Project Overview
---
The NCAA Tournament, March Madness, so many peoples favorite time of the year, basketball, passion, heart, upsets, all of it is on display to the fullest for 3-4 weeks every year (except 2020 sadly). I am not much of a college basketball enthusiast in general, I have always enjoyed the NBA more, but I cant help but get pulled into March Madness every single year. Never has something been more aptly named because thats what it is, madness. And anyone who has ever made a bracket knows this. Since the field opened to 64 teams noone has ever even gotten close to having a perfect bracket. The closest ever was 44 straight correct predictions. The chances of a perfect bracket are 1 in 9.2 quintillion, a little better if you are someone who watches college basketball of course. But my goal is not to get a perfect bracket by any means but instead just to try an get a better idea of what stats correlate to teams doing well or doing poorly during the tournament.

The idea of this project is just to try and analyze data on previous NCAA tournaments to see if I can find any similarities or data that can help provide insight on the current NCAA tournament. This is just a fun little side project that I hope I can use in the future to help with my March Madness Brackets.

## Data
---
The data I used is from a kaggle dataset, College Basketball Dataset by Andrew Sundberg. 

## Notebook Data
---
- Gathering Specific Data: Basic overview of the general data obtained from the kaggle dataset. Just a look at the data there as well as some removal of very unnecessary data
- Data_Cleaning: Cleaning up data further, this time focusing on 3 sets of data (the cbb_21 with the 2021 season data, the cbb general with all the teams from 2013-2019 that made the tournament, and a new cbb_avg that i made with all the data from the 2013-2019 season averaged by post season finish). And using those 3 to make sure all the columns had the same name, and they all had the same statistics available
- Similarity_Matrix: Used to run multiple Matrices to compare the 2021 teams to past teams and general team performance by their postseason finish. This is used to then generate CSV files with data on the similarity between the teams to be visualized later.
- CSV Files: All stored in a separate folder to keep the overall look clean
- Visualizations: All visuals created from the data using Tableau to provide the visualizations with a cleaner Look. Also added the tableau workbook for people to be able to go in and look at more specific things as well
